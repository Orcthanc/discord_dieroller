# DieRollbot

Written using the Parser/Lexer from https://github.com/dabeaz/ply. 
Needs the binary compiled from my Project https://github.com/Orcthanc/PDFtoJSON. 
Reads the bot token from the environment variable "DISCORD_TOKEN".
The bot reads, writes and deletes files on disk, and I'm not doing enough input validation, so only use it at your own risk in controlled environments.
